R-vmsbase
=========

VMSbase is an R suite for the analysis of vessel monitoring system (VMS) and 
logbook data, which constitute two of the primary sources of information for 
spatially explicit models of the fishing effort. It is conceived to solve many 
of the nuisance details related to this specific kind of data, providing a 
straightforward path from data massaging and management to sophisticated 
analyses and outputs.

========
This fork aims to modify the base package to extend its use beyond Europe and add Spanish language.
